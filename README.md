# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to look at employee demographics to help determine if Pewlett Hackard (PH) needs to prepare for the upcoming retirements of many employees. PH previously only used excel spreadsheets to store all of their data. 

I helped them organize the spreadsheets into a linked database using SQL.

## Results

* Most of the employees that are eligbile for retirement soon are in Senior Engineer & Senior Staff positions - right around 70%. This means that there will likely be many important roles that will need to be staffed in the upcoming years.

* Most of the emplyoyees that are eligible to be mentors are also mostly Senior Engineers & Senior Staffs. This means that PH is at risk of losing employees that could help mentor the next generation of senior employees. They should perhaps expand mentorship eligibility or incentifize being a mentor so they don't run out of candidates.

* About 30% of employees are eligible for retirement, and roughly 30% of each job title. The only title with a lower % is manager - coming it at 22%. I found these numbers by pivoting out the most recent titles of all employees that are still at the company.

*Include two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight
### Lack of managers in database:

There are only two managers active in the database. This likely means that the database is missing some important information.
